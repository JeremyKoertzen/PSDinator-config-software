Idea is to use a simple acsii instruction set to send configuration commands to the FPGA on board for the actual configuration of the PSD and CFD chips.


Our syntax follows this simple structure, very loosely inspired by the SCPI standard. 


**GENERAL STRUCTURE**

COMMAND_TYPE : TARGET_CHIP : CONFIG_INST : VALUE


### Top level - Command Type
